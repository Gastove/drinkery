## Hot in the Shade

A variation on a Hotel Nacional, but also an entire drink all its own. 

### Ingredients

- 1.5oz Aged Rum
- 1oz pineapple juice 
- 0.5oz lime juice 
- 0.5oz orgeat
- 0.5oz port

**Serve In**: A big, tall glass -- more like a pint than a collins.
**Finish With**: A straw

### Directions

- Fill your glass with, ideally, crushed ice. 
- Stir together everything _except_ the port, over ice, in a normal stirring carafe. 
- Strain into the glass. 
- Top up your glass with even more crushed ice. Mound it on top. 
- Float the port
