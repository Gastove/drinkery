## Negroni
This is so classic it barely needs mentioning. It's also so classic that I was embarrassed to find I hadn't written it down.

### Ingredients
* 1oz gin
* 1oz Campari
* 1oz sweet vermouth

**Serve In**: Whatever you like, up or over; my favorite is up in a rocks glass.
**Finish With**: Lemon zest

### Tools
* Stirring vessel
* Stirring Spoon
* Julep Spoon or Hawthorne Strainer

### Directions
1. Stir all ingredients over ice
2. Strain into glass

### Variations
There are a truly extraordinary number of ways to vary a Negroni. Think of it this way: it's 1:1:1 herbal, sweet, and bitter. You can go a lot of ways with that.

One way I like to go is simply in exploring how many ways this drink can come together as a Negroni given different gin/vermouth/amaro inputs. I tend to like punchy, herbal, junipery gins, so I vary the gin less. Cinzano vermouth sweetens the drink more; Carpano gives it tooth and drive. Punt e Mes makes a strong substitute for Campari.

Departing from proper Negronis, I have two favorites so far:

#### The Trident
Created by Robert Hess, the Trident replaces the usual Negroni triplet with weird analogues:

* 1oz aquavit
* 1oz dry sherry
* 1oz Cynar
* 2 dashes Fee Brother's peach bitters

#### The Old Pal
A Rye Negroni?! Yes. A Rye Negroni. Spicy, bitter, clear: an amazing drink for summer evenings with lightning on the horizon.

* 1.5oz rye
* 0.75oz Campari
* 0.75oz dry vermouth
