## French 75

### Ingredients
* 1.5oz gin (I prefer something a more junipery, London dry style)
* 0.75oz lemon juice
* 1/2oz simple syrup
* 2-3oz champagne (or champagne-style equivalent, e.g. prosecco, cava; pink fizzy wine is v. nice in this, but stay dry.)

**Serve In**: Flutes are traditional, but ridiculous; I use a stemless wine glass.
**Finish With**: Lemon zest

### Tools
* Stirring vessel
* Stirring Spoon
* Julep Spoon or Hawthorne Strainer

### Directions
1. First three ingredients over ice in the vessel
2. Stir thoroughly
3. Pour into serving glass
4. Top with wine

### Variations
My favorite variation I call the French 9000 (like a French 75, with the power level WAY UP). To make one, substitute lemon-dominant [_oleo saccharum_](/inputs/oleo_saccharum.markdown) for simple syrup. For myself, I also cut the syrup back by 1/2. It's a touch sweeter, brightly lemony.
