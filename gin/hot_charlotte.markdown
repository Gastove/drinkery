## Hot Charlotte

This marvel is the brain-child of Murray Spence, for many years the mastermind
of the Zig Zag Cafe in Seattle, Washington. I adore this drink on a hot evening,
or with fried chicken, or any time I think of it. 

### Ingredients

* 1.5 oz Hendrick's Gin
* 1.5 oz St. Germane Elderflower Liquer
* 0.5 oz lemon juice
* Cucumber
* Hot Sauce (You can use tabasco; I prefer Sriracha)

**Serve In**: Rocks Glass, or anything that holds about 12oz of stuff
**Finish With**: Cucumber Wheel

### Tools

* Muddler
* Pint Glass
* Boston Shaker
* Julep Spoon
* Mesh Strainer

### Directions

1. Put 2-3 slices of cucumber in the bottom of a pint glass.
2. Add hot sauce to taste; I use a generous tablespoon for mine, but I'm a
fire-eater.
3. Add lemon; muddle thoroughly.
4. Add gin and St. Germane.
5. Fill shaker with ice; shake the bajeebus out of it.
6. Strain over fresh ice.
7. Garnish with lemon
8. Serve

### Variations

This one is amazing to monkey with. I like to substitute the lemon for 6 oz of
lemonade, make it in a huge batch, and let it soak on some bruised lemongrass
overnight before serving.
