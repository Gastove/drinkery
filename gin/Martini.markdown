## Martini

To make a good Martini, you must first defeat the Three Martini Icons that, by and large, keep the drink from being any good.

#### Icon One: No Vermouth
"[Famous person, probably Churchill] used to make a martini by glancing significantly across the room at the vermouth". My friends, this is baloney.

I could go on at some length about the history of the Martini, but I wont here. The important bit is this: if you want a glass of good gin on ice, _just have that_. If you want a glass of good gin stirred with ice and then strained, ask for that. If you want a Martini, put some damn vermouth in it. I like a 3-8 vermouth-gin martini.

#### Icon Two: The Olive
Check this out: _you don't have to have your Martini with an olive._ I don't care for olives in my Martinis at all -- I prefer lemon zest.

#### Icon Three: 007

"Shaken, not stirred" is a great way to get a Martini full of ice flecks, cold and too watery. Let the poor bartender stir it, and stir it yourself. The drink will be substantially better.

**Do note**: this is as simple as a cocktail gets. If you don't like the way one of your ingredients tastes on its own, that ingredient isn't going to have anything to cuddle up with for improvement. If you have a gin you don't enjoy straight but want to mix, the Martini is probably not going to get you there -- consider a [Gin and Tonic](gin_and_tonic.markdown) or a Negroni. Cheap vermouth is more flexible, but you'll still taste the improvement if you can score a bottle of Dolin Blanc. Likewise, if you're able to find a gin you enjoy and you put it in your Martini, you're gonna love that martini. So my advice: care about your Martini, as much as you're able.
