## Martini

To make a good Martini, you must first defeat the Three Martini Icons that, by and large, keep the drink from being any good.

#### Icon One: No Vermouth
"[Famous person, probably Churchill] used to make a martini by glancing significantly across the room at the vermouth". My friends, this is baloney.

I could go on at some length about the history of the Martini, but I wont here. The important bit is this: if you want a glass of good gin on ice, _just have that_. If you want a glass of good gin stirred with ice and then strained, ask for that. If you want a Martini, put some damn vermouth in it. I like a 3-8 vermouth-gin martini.

#### Icon Two: The Olive
Check this out: _you don't have to have your Martini with an olive._ I don't care for olives in my Martinis at all -- I prefer lemon zest.

#### Icon Three: 007

"Shaken, not stirred" is a great way to get a Martini full of ice flecks, cold and too watery. Let the poor bartender stir it, and stir it yourself. The drink will be substantially better.

**Do note**: this is as simple as a cocktail gets. There's nowhere to hide mediocre ingredients. If all you have is a bottle of crummy gin and a portion of Martini and Rossi, just... skip the Martini that night, OK? Take the time to find a gin you like and care about (I like Broker's, Hendricks, St. George's Botanivore). Use Dolin Blanc vermouth, or something comparably nice.
