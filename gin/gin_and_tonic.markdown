## Gin and Tonic

Quintessential. Easy. Only one rule: garbage in, garbage out. So:

1. Use decent tonic (Fever Tree and Q Tonic leap to mind)
2. Use a decent gin (Broker's, for instance)

### Ingredients
* 2oz gin
* 4oz tonic
* _One_ of:
** Lime
** Cucumber Slice
* Ice

**Serve In**: A big Rocks Glass

### Directions
1. Ice in glass
2. Gin over ice
3. Fill with tonic
4. Finish with lime or cucumber

### Variations
**Tall G&T** On very hot days, I make a single gin and tonic into a pint glass of ice -- 2oz of gin and 8oz of tonic. Extra lime.
