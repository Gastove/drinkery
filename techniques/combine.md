## Combining Ingredients

Sometimes, a cocktail takes incredibly specialized steps -- you _must_ execute this technique, _then_ this step with _only these two ingredients_...

...but lets be honest, most cocktail making follows one of very few patters. I have refactored these patterns in to this short instructional document. If a cocktail doesn't follow one of these patterns, my recipe will say so, very explicitly.


### The Grid

In most cases, you make the following choice

| Combine | and | Serve |
| ------- |---- | ----- |
| shake |  | up |
| | X | |
| stir |  | over |

Shake or Stir? Remember this rule:
- Do you want to see through the drink? Is it spirits-only (*no* fruit juice)? --> Stir
- Is there fruit juice, creme de cacao, or another opaque ingredient in, or does clarity just not matter? --> Shake

### Stir
#### Tools
* A Mixing Vessel -- a pint glass or stirring carafe
* A Mixing Implement -- a bar spoon, stirring stick, chopstick, butter knife, or well scrubbed table leg
* A Straining Implement -- if you've got a pint glass to mix in, choose a Julep Spoon. If you've got nearly anything else, use coarse ice and a Hawthorne Strainer -- or in a pinch, a fine sieve.
* A Serving Glass

#### Technique
1. Fill your mixing vessel  half full (ish) of ice.
2. Pour all of your liquid ingredients in to your vessel.
3. Stir until the outside of the vessel feels **really** cold.
4. Strain in to the serving glass.
5. Apply garnish or finisher.

Done!

### Shake
#### Tools
I'm  opinionated about this one. Y'see, there are all these things that get called "Martini Shakers" or "Cocktail Shakers" -- and almost every one of them is terrible. Most suffer from this problem: as the drink chills, the lid will contract and become very, very stuck. Now that your drink is shaken, you'll spend the rest of the night trying to gain access to your hard-earned beverage.

I recommend you use:
* A Boston Shaker -- the metal cup you see in every bar, everywhere.
* A Pint Glass -- 16oz, glass, done.
* A Two-Piece Straining Ensemble: a Hawthorne Strainer; a small, fine strainer.

#### Technique
1. Measure your ingredients in to the pint glass.
2. Fill the Shaker half-full of ice.
3. In one movement, pour the contents of the pint glass in to the shaker and settle the pint glass on top, forming a capsule.
4. Bang the butt of the pint glass with your fist -- knock the two pieces firmly together.
5. Pick up the capsule.
6. Hold firmly.
7. Shake the ever holy bajoley out of the capsule. Seriously. I hope your grip is firm -- you really wanna go to town on this thing. Pattern doesn't matter; neither does rhythm. Not letting the halves fly apart does -- how's your grip holding up?
8. When the Boston shaker is almost uncomfortably cold to the touch, you're good.
9. Place the capsule shaker-side down on the counter.
10. Put your off-hand against the joint between the shaker and the pint glass.
11. With your dominant hand, smack the metal of the joint, with your palm. Smack it pretty solidly. You should hear the sound of a vacuum releasing.
12. Lift the pint glass off the top of the whole works, set it aside.
13. Fit a Hawthorne Strainer on to the top of the Boston Shaker.
14. Pour the drink through the fine strainer, in to the serving glass. If the drinks strains slowly, tap the side of the strainer with the butt of the Boston Shaker.

### Long Drinks
A "Long Drink" -- a drink with a fizzy ingredient -- is neither shaken nor stirred. Think Gin & Tonic, French 75, Americano -- you wouldn't want one of those shaken, it would be all flat and sad.

Assemble your long drink directly in to the serving glass using the following basic approach:
1. If ice is used, start with that, in your serving glass.
2. If you can get away with it, add your fizzy ingredient next. I don't like pouring my fizzy stuff around -- champagne poured in to a measuring cup, then in to a drink, will be much more flat than if you cut out the measure. So: if you're familiar enough with your serving glass, do fizzy stuff first, then measured spirits. Otherwise, do spirits, then fill with lengthener.
3. Finally, float your most viscous ingredients on top -- think creme de cassis. Use a spoon if you need to, to get good separation of layers. (To do this, lower the bowl of a bar spoon down to the serface of the drink. You want to pour gently in to the bowl of the spoon, so that the thick spirit fills the spoon, then gently floods out to the top layer of the drink.
