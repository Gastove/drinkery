### Ingredients
* 1.5oz Rye Whiskey
* 3/4oz French Vermouth
* 3/4oz (Unsweetened) Pineapple Juice
* Cracked Ice

**Garnish With**: Orange Zest
**Serve In**: Rocks Glass

### Tools
* Pint glass
* Bar spoon
* Measure

### Directions
2. In the pint glass, combine whiskey, vermouth, and pineapple juice.
3. Add ice to the pint glass, stir until chilled. Shake only if you want
   pineapple foam.
4. Strain into the serving glass.
5. Twist orange zest, serve.

#### Notes

Increase sweetness with vermouth, not pineapple juice. Decrease
sweetness with bitters, not vermouth.

I (James) usually give it one to two shakes at the end to produce a very
small layer of pineapple foam for that egg white finish.
