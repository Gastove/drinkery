## The Old Fashioned

Jeffery Morgenthaler has done some [good writing](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2012/brandy-old-fashioned/) about the misbegotten beverage we often call an Old Fashioned. I like an old-school Old Fashioned, with almost nothing in it.

### Ingredients
* 2oz Rye Whiskey
* 1/4oz Simple Syrup
* Angostura Bitters
* Ice

**Garnish With**: Orange Peel, Cherry
**Serve in**: Rocks Grlass

### Tools
* Pint glass
* Bar spoon
* Measure
* Muddler

### Directions
1. Put the simple syrup in the bottom of the rocks glass. Shake in 2-3 dashes bitters.
2. Twist the peel into the glass. Use a muddler to press the oils from the peel in to the sugar and bitters.
3. Add 2-3 large ice cubes and the whiskey. Stir fir a moment.
4. Optional: add a cherry.
5. Enjoy

#### Notes

You can use almost any aromatic bitters in this cocktail. You can also use bourbon instead of rye; I like the spiciness of good rye, but bourbon brings its own richness to the drink. When I use bourbon, I use even less simple syrup.
