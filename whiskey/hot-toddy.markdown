## Hot Toddy

There's nothing quite so good as a hot toddy when it's miserable outside. At it's most basic a hot toddy contains some kind of brown liquor, hot water, some kind of sweetener, and some kind of spice. The variations are just about endless, and some include such dubious ingredients as hot ginger ale, or entire cinnamon sticks.  Here's a good, no-nonsense base to start with.  

### Ingredients
* 1.5oz Rye Whiskey
* 5-6oz Hot Water
* 0.5oz Lemon Juice
* 1 Tbsp Honey

**Garnish With**: Lemon peel
**Serve In**: A mug or a double walled glass

### Directions
1. Add near boiling water to your mug, and stir in the honey
2. Add the other ingredients and garnish 

### Lauren's Variation
I'm a sucker for anise, and I love what it adds to a hot toddy.  I like to start with the recipe above, and add 0.25 oz of Pernod, and garnish with an orange peel instead of a lemon peel.
