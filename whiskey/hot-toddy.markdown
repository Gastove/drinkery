## Hot Toddy

There's nothing quite so good as a hot toddy when it's miserable outside. At it's most basic a hot toddy contains some kind of brown liquor, hot water, some kind of sweetener, and some kind of spice. The variations are just about endless, and some include such dubious ingredients as hot ginger ale, or entire cinnamon sticks.  Below is a recipe I've arrived at through experimentation.  It's relatively simple, but the star-anise flavor of the Pernod makes it shine.  

### Ingredients
* 1.5oz Rye Whiskey
* 5-6oz Hot Water
* 0.5oz Lemon Juice
* 1 Tbsp Honey
* 0.25oz Pernod


**Garnish With**: an orange peel
**Serve In**: A mug or a double walled glass

### Directions
1. Add near boiling water to your mug, and stir in the honey
2. Add the other ingredients and garnish
