## Remember the Maine

I used to play Bartender's Choice with the head barman of Sun Liquor in Seattle. The first time, he made me a Sazerac; the second time, it was a Remember the Maine. This is my idea of a "dessert drink" -- sweet (for me), but with personality. Goes down awfully well with chocolate desserts.

### Ingredients
* 2oz Rye Whiskey
* 0.75oz Sweet Vermouth
* 2 bar-spoons Cherry Heering
* Spare bar-spoon Absinthe

**Garnish With**: A brandied cherry or three. Give Maraschinos a miss for this; they're too syrupy.
**Serve In**: Something lovely and not too big. A nice coupe, maybe, or a narrow half-sized rocks glass.

### Tools
* Pint Glass
* Bar Spoon
* Hawthorne Strainer

### Directions
1. Fill pint glass with ice.
2. Add all ingredients.
3. Strain in to the serving glass.
4. Add cherries.

### Variations
This drink is itself a Manhattan variation. You can go roughly a bazillion different directions from here. My advice? Keep it simple.
