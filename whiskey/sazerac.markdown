This is an old drink; I like mine simple.

### Tools
* Pint glass
* Bar spoon
* Measure
* Julep Spoon

2. In the pint glass, combine whiskey, simple syrup, five dashes of Peychaud's Bitters, and one dash of Angostura
3. Add ice to the pint glass, stir until chilled.
4. Strain into the serving glass.
5. Twist orange zest, serve.

#### Notes

You'll see all manner of suggestions for how to apply enough Herbsaint/Absinthe to this drink, and just as much debate over what the "correct" anise liqueur is. I like Herbsaint; it's a little sharp, and I like that about it. I like a rinse of the glass, rather than a measure in the pint glass or a vaporizer or any such thing -- I find it gives the drink a heady quality I quite enjoy. A lemon is more common, but I appreciate the sweetness of orange.
