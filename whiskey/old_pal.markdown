## Old Pal

I love this thing. Dry, spicy, bright, bitter -- one of my favorites in autumn.

### Ingredients
* 1.5oz Rye Whiskey
* 0.75oz Campari or Gran Classico
* 0.75oz Dry Vermouth

**Serve In**: A nice coup if you've got one; I love the way this one smells, so I often use a broad rocks glass, much as I do for good whiskey.
**Finish With**: Lemon zest

### Tools
* Pint Glass
* Bar Spoon
* Measure
* Julep Spoon
* Peeler (for zest)

### Directions
1. Half-fill your pint glass with ice
2. Add all liquid ingredients
3. Stir until well chilled
4. Strain in to serving glass
5. Twist zest and serve

### Variations

This drink is itself a variation on a Negroni.

If you can find a bottle of Gran Classico (Tempus Fugit out of Petaluma, CA makes it), put it in this. Holy smokes.
