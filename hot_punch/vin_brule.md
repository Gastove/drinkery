## Vin Brûlé

This is an Italian mulled wine with a French name. It is completely delicious.

### Ingredients
Per Batch:
- 1 750ml Bottle Red Wine
- 2 star anise
- 2 sticks cinnamon
- Zest two oranges
- Zest two lemons
- 2 cloves
- 2 allspice
- Scant half-cup sugar
- 6oz good brandy

### Directions
Do at least this:

Put everything but the brandy in a pot; heat to the lowest possible simmer. When it's piping hot, hold it there for 20 minutes. Add brandy, strain, and serve.

Optionally: BRÛLÉ!
Many recipes on the web will tell you *not* to do this, "because it harms the flavor." It's definitely different; it's a better showpiece, for _sure_. It also winds up lower alcohol, a more laid-back drink for all-day sipping, instead of a cozy cup of hold still.

To do this: add the brandy, raise the temperature, clap a lit on the pot; once you hear steam trying to push at the pot lid, light a long match or similar device, lift the lid, and light the works on fire. Let it burn for a hot minute; you don't wanna cook off all the alcohol, so give it maybe 30 seconds, then cut the burner and clap a lid on.

#### Notes

**Picking a wine**: I think this is best with something low tannin; Italian reds like San Giovese or Barbera are good. Honestly, I like Bota Box Cab Savignon for this -- it's cheap, you get four bottles of it at once, and the result is very satisfying.

**Picking a Brandy**: You can seriously use nearly any brandy you want, but this is a place where I use a brandy I'd happily drink a glass of. The brandy provides a lot of spine, a lot of the character of the final drink. I default to good French cognac (my go-to is Salignac); a fruit brandy (e.g. pear, orange) will give a corresponding fruit flavor. Be a little cautious of overly sweet brandies! There's nothing wrong with them, but you may want to back off the refined sugar.
