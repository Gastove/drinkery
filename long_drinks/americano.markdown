## Americano

The story I hear is that this drink -- much like the espresso drink of same name -- was invented in Italy and named for the Americans who took a liking to it. Tall and cold, an ideal aperitif.

### Ingredients
* 1.5oz Campari or Gran Classico
* 1.5oz Sweet Vermouth
* Soda Water to taste (I like 5-6 ounces)
* Orange Zest

Note: I like Cinzano for my vermouth; Carpano is too... heavy-duty.

**Serve In**: A Collin's Glass

### Tools
* Peeler

### Directions
1. Put ice in your Collins glass
2. Add both liqueurs
3. Add orange zest
4. Fill glass with soda water
5. Stir _very_ gently and oh-so-briefly
