My little black bartending book.

#### So what the heck is going on here?

I started keeping track of cocktail recipes a million years ago when all my notes were in Evernote. Evernote couldn't keep up with me, so now my recipe book is here.

Organization is going to be flexible for a little bit; development is going to take a little time. Interested? File a pull request. I love ideas and contributions. Fair warning: this is _my_ little black book, subject to my own... idiosyncratic approach to drinking (more on this in a second). If I don't want to know how to make the thing you've added, I'm not going to add it here. Poke around a little, get a feel for the things I sip on. Fork this, if you fancy! And drink well. That's the whole point, right?

#### What's in here, then?

I like a lot of different things. As a rule, I don't like anything particularly sweet -- so you'll find very little in here of the Mudslide/sugary shots variety. In fact, you aren't going to find any "shots" at all. This is, first and foremost, a little black book for _cocktails_. What's a cocktail? Damn fine question; somewhat difficult to answer. I'm going to use this definition:

> A cocktail is a beverage, intended to be sipped, made from some combination of spirits (whiskey, gin, fortified wine), a diluting agent (water, champagne), and flavors like bitters, sugar syrup, and fruit.

Sure, there are a lot of great ways to drink this doesn't encompass -- for instance, a Polish approach to drinking vodka involving rye bread and a good deal of pepper. This is for cocktails.

I like spirit-driven drinks. Up, over, or long -- I'm not particular, so long as my drink isn't too sweet. On that note, here is a PSA:

> **Unless stated explicitly otherwise, I use 1:1 Simple Syrup**. The 2:1 (or "Rich" syrup) is too heavy-duty for me.

Some drinks I **don't** like:

* Anything day-glo
* Anything extremely sugary
* Anything made with energy drinks
* Most drinks with performatively stupid names.

I'm also not including many recipes of the "rum and coke" variety, with limited exceptions. If the recipe is in the name, it's _less_ likely to be in here.

#### How's it organized

Optimistically.

...seriously, that bit is a work in progress. Stay tuned, or make suggestions.
