My little black bartending book

#### So what the heck is going on here?

Here is a thing I like to do: I drink cocktails; I figure out how to make the ones I like; I note the recipe. Those recipes have lives for some time in Evernote, but Evernote is static -- share-able, so long as you only share with other Evernote users. Tools for resolving conflicts between collaborations are rudimentary. So: I'm moving things here.

Organization is going to be flexible for a little bit; development is going to take a little. Interested? File a pull request. I love ideas and contributions.


#### What's in here, then?

I like a lot of different things. As a rule, I don't like anything particularly sweet -- so you'll find very little in here of the Mudslide/sugary shots variety.
