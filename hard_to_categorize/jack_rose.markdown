## Jack Rose

Another old classic. If you're in to things like "Steinbeck drank this," you've found a great drink. I like 'em in spring and summer, and warm days in fall.

### Ingredients
- 2oz Applejack
- 1/2oz Grenadine
- 3/4oz lemon or lime juice (I prefer lime)

**Serve In**: Rocks Glass
**Finish With**: Lime peel or Apple Slice (stands OK without)

### Tools
* Pint glass
* Bar spoon
* Measure
* Julep Spoon

### Directions
Combine ingredients over ice; strain into glass. Can be served up or over.

#### Notes
Use a quarter-ounce more grenadine if you find bonded Applejack, which is much stronger.

I've been stirring mine, but there's enough fruit juice that shaking wont ruin the clarity, so go for it if you're so incline.
